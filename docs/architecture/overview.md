# Architecture Overview

## System Architecture

Meowsenger follows a microservices architecture pattern with three main services:

### 1. Frontend Service
- **Technology**: Next.js with App Router
- **Purpose**: Handles user interface and client-side logic
- **Key Features**:
  - Real-time updates using WebSocket
  - Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
  - Internationalization support
  - Dark/Light theme support

### 2. Backend Service
- **Technology**: Django with Django REST Framework
- **Purpose**: Manages user data, authentication, and business logic
- **Key Features**:
  - User management
  - Authentication and authorization
  - Profile management
  - Group management

### 3. Messaging Service
- **Technology**: Spring Boot
- **Purpose**: Handles real-time messaging and WebSocket communications
- **Key Features**:
  - WebSocket connections
  - Message routing
  - Real-time updates
  - Minigame support

## Communication Flow

1. **Client-Server Communication**:
   - REST APIs for regular HTTP requests
   - WebSocket for real-time communication
   - GraphQL for complex data queries (planned)

2. **Service-to-Service Communication**:
   - REST APIs between services
   - Message queues for async operations
   - WebSocket for real-time updates

## Data Flow

1. **User Authentication**:
   ```
   Client -> Backend -> Database
   ```

2. **Messaging**:
   ```
   Client -> Messaging Service -> WebSocket -> Other Clients
   ```

3. **Data Synchronization**:
   ```
   Client -> Backend -> Database
   Backend -> Messaging Service -> Other Clients
   ```

## Security

- JWT-based authentication
- HTTPS for all communications
- WebSocket security with token validation
- Rate limiting and request validation

## Scalability

- Horizontal scaling support for all services
- Load balancing ready
- Database sharding capabilities
- Caching layer (planned)

## Monitoring and Logging

- Centralized logging system
- Performance monitoring
- Error tracking
- Health checks

## Future Considerations

1. **Planned Improvements**:
   - GraphQL implementation
   - Advanced caching
   - CDN integration
   - Enhanced analytics

2. **Potential Additions**:
   - File sharing service
   - Media processing service
   - Analytics service
   - Notification service
